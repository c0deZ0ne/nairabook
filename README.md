## Description
This project is a Node.js backend server that uses in-memory data structures to store and manage data. The server provides endpoints to interact with the data. Optionally, a NoSQL database can be used for data storage, and a basic React frontend can be created to interact with the API. Both the backend and frontend are available for testing in the provided solution.
